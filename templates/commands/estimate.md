# Project Estimation Command

Provide comprehensive project estimation for: $ARGUMENTS

This command delivers intelligent project complexity assessment and resource estimation with automatic expert consultation.

## Intelligent Estimation Framework

### Auto-Analysis System
The estimate command automatically analyzes project characteristics and consults appropriate specialists:

```markdown
# Automatic Expert Consultation Based on Project Type:
- Complex architecture → refactoring-expert sub-agent for design complexity
- Security requirements → security-auditor sub-agent for security overhead
- Testing strategy → test-specialist sub-agent for QA effort estimation
- Quality standards → code-reviewer sub-agent for implementation rigor
- Documentation needs → documentation-writer sub-agent for docs effort
```

### Multi-Dimensional Assessment
```markdown
# Comprehensive estimation factors:
Technical Complexity:
- Architecture and design complexity
- Integration requirements and dependencies
- Performance and scalability needs
- Security and compliance requirements

Resource Requirements:
- Development effort and skill requirements
- Testing and quality assurance effort
- Security review and hardening time
- Documentation and knowledge transfer

Risk Factors:
- Technical unknowns and research needs
- External dependencies and integration risks

## Advanced Estimation Patterns

### Pattern A: Agile Sprint Planning
```markdown
# For agile project estimation:
"Auto-coordinated sprint planning estimation:"

1. refactoring-expert: "Break down architecture into implementable components"
2. test-specialist: "Estimate testing effort for each component"
3. security-auditor: "Identify security tasks and effort per sprint"
4. Main context: "Synthesize into sprint-sized deliverables"
```

### Pattern B: Risk-Adjusted Estimation
```markdown
# For high-uncertainty projects:
"Risk-adjusted estimation with specialist consultation:"

Base Estimates (Specialist Input):
- Optimistic scenario: [X days]
- Most likely scenario: [Y days]  
- Pessimistic scenario: [Z days]

Risk-Adjusted Final Estimate:
- (Optimistic + 4*Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6 = [Final estimate]
```

### Pattern C: Comparative Analysis
```markdown
# For similar project estimation:
"Comparative estimation with historical data:"

1. code-reviewer: "Analyze similar past projects for complexity comparison"
2. test-specialist: "Compare testing requirements with historical projects"
3. security-auditor: "Assess security effort against similar implementations"
4. Main context: "Apply lessons learned and adjustment factors"
```
