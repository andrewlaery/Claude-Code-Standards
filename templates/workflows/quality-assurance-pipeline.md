# Quality Assurance Pipeline Workflow

Comprehensive quality assurance workflow with intelligent sub-agent coordination for ensuring consistent, high-quality software delivery.

## Pipeline Overview

This workflow establishes a systematic quality assurance process with automatic specialist coordination, inspired by SuperClaude's intelligent routing and quality-focused approach.

### Quality Philosophy
- **Preventive Quality**: Build quality in from the start rather than testing it in at the end
- **Continuous Validation**: Quality checks at every stage of development
- **Specialist Expertise**: Leverage domain experts for comprehensive quality assessment
- **Automated Coordination**: Intelligent routing of quality tasks to appropriate specialists

## Multi-Stage Quality Pipeline

## Quality Gate Decision Framework

### Quality Gate Criteria
```markdown
# Decision criteria for quality gate progression

Go/No-Go Decision Matrix:
1. All specialist quality assessments: [Must be "Go" from all specialists]
2. Quality metrics thresholds: [All metrics must meet or exceed thresholds]
3. Quality issue resolution: [All critical issues resolved]
4. Quality documentation: [Complete and up-to-date]

Quality Gate Escalation:
- If any specialist provides "No-Go" assessment → Immediate issue resolution required
- If quality metrics below threshold → Quality improvement plan required
- If critical quality issues unresolved → Quality gate blocked until resolution
```
