# Complex Feature Orchestration Workflow

Comprehensive workflow pattern for managing complex, multi-domain features with intelligent sub-agent coordination.

## Orchestration Overview

This workflow demonstrates advanced coordination patterns inspired by SuperClaude's orchestration capabilities, providing structured management of complex development tasks with automatic expert coordination.

### When to Use This Pattern
- Features spanning multiple technical domains (frontend, backend, security, testing)
- Complex integrations requiring specialized expertise
- High-stakes implementations with significant business impact
- Projects requiring comprehensive quality assurance and documentation

## Phase-Based Orchestration

### Phase 1: Discovery and Planning
```markdown
# Intelligent analysis and planning coordination

## Auto-Activation Pattern:
Based on feature scope, automatically coordinate relevant specialists:

Discovery Team Activation:
- refactoring-expert sub-agent: "Analyze current architecture for [FEATURE] integration points"
- security-auditor sub-agent: "Identify security considerations for [FEATURE]"
- test-specialist sub-agent: "Plan comprehensive testing strategy for [FEATURE]"

## Coordinated Analysis Tasks:
Parallel Sub-Agent Investigation:
1. Architecture Analysis (refactoring-expert):
   - Current system integration points
   - Scalability implications
   - Performance considerations
   - Technical debt that must be addressed

2. Security Assessment (security-auditor):
   - Threat modeling for new feature
   - Authentication/authorization requirements
   - Data protection needs
   - Compliance considerations

3. Testing Strategy (test-specialist):
   - Test coverage requirements
   - Testing approach (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Test data and environment needs
   - Quality metrics and acceptance criteria

## Integration and Planning:
Main context synthesizes specialist input:
- Create unified architecture plan
- Identify dependencies and critical path
- Establish quality gates and milestones
- Define success criteria and rollback plans
```

### Phase 2: Architecture and Design
```markdown
# Coordinated design phase with specialist input

## Design Coordination Pattern:
Sequential specialist consultation for comprehensive design:

1. Architecture Design (refactoring-expert sub-agent):
   "Design optimal architecture for [FEATURE] considering:"
   - System integration patterns
   - Component organization
   - Data flow and API design
   - Performance and scalability requirements

2. Security Architecture Review (security-auditor sub-agent):
   "Review proposed architecture for security implications:"
   - Security controls and access patterns
   - Data protection mechanisms
   - API security considerations
   - Compliance alignment

3. Testing Architecture (test-specialist sub-agent):
   "Design testing architecture supporting [FEATURE]:"
   - Test pyramid strategy
   - Test automation framework
   - Data management for testing
   - Continuous testing integration

## Design Integration:
Main context coordinates final design:
- Incorporate all specialist recommendations
- Resolve conflicts and optimize trade-offs
- Create detailed implementation roadmap
- Establish development standards for feature
```

### Phase 3: Implementation Coordination
```markdown
# Multi-stream implementation with continuous quality assurance

## Parallel Development Streams:
Coordinate multiple development tracks with specialist oversight:

Stream A: Core Implementation
- Main context: Core feature development
- Continuous consultation with refactoring-expert for architecture adherence
- Regular check-ins with code-reviewer for quality maintenance

Stream B: Quality Assurance Track  
- test-specialist sub-agent: Parallel test development
- Continuous integration test development
- Quality metrics monitoring and reporting

Stream C: Security Implementation
- security-auditor sub-agent: Security feature implementation
- Security testing and validation
- Compliance verification

## Integration Checkpoints:
Regular cross-stream coordination:
1. Daily: Quick alignment on progress and blockers
2. Weekly: Comprehensive integration testing
3. Milestone: Full quality gate review with all specialists
```

### Phase 4: Integration and Validation
```markdown
# Comprehensive integration testing with specialist validation

## Coordinated Integration Testing:
Multi-specialist validation approach:

1. Functional Integration (test-specialist sub-agent):
   "Execute comprehensive integration testing:"
   - Feature functionality validation
   - Cross-component integration testing
   - End-to-end workflow validation
   - Performance and load testing

2. Security Validation (security-auditor sub-agent):
   "Perform security integration testing:"
   - Security control validation
   - Penetration testing (if applicable)
   - Data protection verification
   - Compliance audit preparation

3. Quality Assessment (code-reviewer sub-agent):
   "Conduct final code quality review:"
   - Code quality and maintainability assessment
   - Architecture compliance verification
   - Performance optimization review
   - Technical debt evaluation

## Integration Coordination:
Main context manages integration process:
- Coordinate specialist validation activities
- Manage integration issue resolution
- Verify all quality gates are satisfied
- Prepare for production deployment
```

### Phase 5: Deployment and Monitoring
```markdown
# Coordinated deployment with comprehensive monitoring setup

## Deployment Orchestration:
Specialist-supported deployment strategy:

1. Pre-Deployment Validation:
   - security-auditor: Final security clearance
   - test-specialist: Production readiness testing
   - code-reviewer: Final quality assessment

2. Deployment Coordination:
   - Main context: Deployment execution and monitoring
   - test-specialist: Post-deployment validation testing
   - security-auditor: Security monitoring setup

3. Post-Deployment Activities:
   - documentation-writer sub-agent: Final documentation update
   - All specialists: Lessons learned documentation
   - Main context: Success metrics collection
```

## Advanced Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern A: Risk-Driven Orchestration
```markdown
# For high-risk features requiring enhanced oversight

Risk Assessment Phase:
1. security-auditor: "Comprehensive risk assessment for [FEATURE]"
