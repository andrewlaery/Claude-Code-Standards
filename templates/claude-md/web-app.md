# Project: [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]

## Core Principles
**IMPORTANT**: Whenever you write code, it MUST follow SOLID design principles. Never write code that violates these principles. If you do, you will be asked to refactor it.

## Development Workflow
1. Before making any changes, create and checkout a feature branch named `feature-[brief-description]`
2. Write comprehensive tests for all new functionality
3. Compile code and run all tests before committing
4. Write detailed commit messages explaining the changes and rationale
5. Commit all changes to the feature branch

## Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand for client state, React Query for server state
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new code with strict type checking
- Follow the existing component structure in `/src/components`
- API routes follow RESTful conventions in `/src/pages/api`
- Use Prisma schema definitions for all database operations
- CSS classes should use Tailwind utilities; custom CSS only when necessary

## Quality Gates
- All code must compile without warnings
- Test coverage must remain above 80%
- All tests must pass before committing
- ESLint and Prettier must pass without errors

## File Organization
- Components: `/src/components/[feature]/[ComponentName].tsx`
- Pages: `/src/pages/[route].tsx`
- Utilities: `/src/lib/[category]/[utility].ts`
- Types: `/src/types/[domain].ts`

## Design Principles
- Follow responsive design patterns for mobile-first development
- Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA labels for accessibility
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Follow the existing design system and component patterns

## Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Add E2E tests for critical user workflows
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Maintain test isolation and repeatability

## Performance Standards
- Optimize bundle size and loading performance
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use lazy loading for components and routes
- Monitor and optimize Core Web Vitals
- Implement proper error logging and monitoring
